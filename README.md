# 🎮 Hue Crew: Flip the Hue

**Hue Crew: Flip the Hue** is a 2D platformer-puzzle game where you flip between black and white backgrounds to reveal or hide obstacles and solve mind-bending platforming challenges. The twist? The world changes based on your chosen background — and so does your path to the goal.
