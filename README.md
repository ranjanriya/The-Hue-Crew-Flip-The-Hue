# 🎮 Hue Crew: Flip the Hue

**Hue Crew: Flip the Hue** is a 2D platformer-puzzle game where you flip between black and white backgrounds to reveal or hide obstacles and solve mind-bending platforming challenges. The twist? The world changes based on your chosen background — and so does your path to the goal.

> 🏫 This project was developed as part of **CSCI 526: Advanced Mobile Devices and Game Consoles** at the **University of Southern California (USC)** during **Fall 2024**, taught by [Professor Scott John Easley](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Easley/Scott).

## 🧠 Game Concept

Navigate tricky levels using your ability to switch the background color in real time. Time your jumps, avoid deadly traps, and master dashing to reach the flag and clear each level.

- ⚡ **Dash Ability** – Quickly burst forward to cross wide gaps or dodge traps.
- 🧗 **Platforming Puzzles** – Layers of platforms, hidden paths, and moving traps demand strategy and reflexes.
- 🔁 **Checkpoint System** – Respawn after a mistake at the last activated checkpoint.
- 📊 **Analytics Tracking** – Gameplay metrics like deaths, dashes, and flips are logged and visualized using Firebase + Python.
- 🖥️ **Web-Based Build** – No downloads! Play directly in your browser.
