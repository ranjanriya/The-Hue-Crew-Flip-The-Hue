# 🎮 Hue Crew: Flip the Hue

**Hue Crew: Flip the Hue** is a 2D platformer-puzzle game with a unique color-switching mechanic. Players can toggle the background between black and white, dynamically revealing or hiding obstacles and traps, to navigate through challenging levels and reach the goal.

## 🧠 Game Concept

Use quick reflexes and strategic thinking to overcome hidden paths, color-based traps, and progressively complex platforming puzzles.

## 🧩 Features

- 🎨 **Color-Switching Mechanic** – Toggle between black and white backgrounds to control which obstacles appear or disappear.
- 💣 **Trap Avoidance** – Navigate through color-sensitive traps that respawn you at the last checkpoint.
- 🧗 **Platforming Puzzles** – Strategically jump, dash, and switch colors to solve layered platform challenges.
- ⚡ **Dash Mechanic** – Perform short bursts to cross gaps or evade hazards.
- 🧠 **Progressive Level Design** – Each level introduces new mechanics and increases in difficulty.
- 🔁 **Checkpoints** – Auto-respawn at the last activated checkpoint after hitting a trap.
- 🧪 **Analytics Integration** – Collect gameplay metrics (deaths, flips, dashes, etc.) using Firebase and visualize with Python.
- 🖥️ **Fully Playable WebGL Builds** – No installation needed; runs directly in the browser.
